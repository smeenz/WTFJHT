1. **Iran's foreign minister accused the U.S. of engaging in "state terrorism" by assassinating Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani**. Javad Zarif said Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran Nuclear Deal and adopt a hardline approach toward Iran has "destroyed stability" in the Middle East and warned that things would get worse if the U.S. does not change its approach. Zarif called the assassination of Soleimani "an act of aggression" and "an armed attack against Iran," but said that Iran plans to "respond proportionally not disproportionally." He added: "We will respond lawfully, we are not lawless people like President Trump." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/07/middleeast/iran-zarif-united-states-intl/index.html))

2. **Defense Secretary Mark Esper acknowledged that Trump's threat that to bomb Iranian cultural sites with no military value would be a war crime and said the U.S. has no intention of doing so**. "We will follow the laws of armed conflict," Esper told reporters. Trump twice threatened on Twitter to strike Iranian cultural sites of that are "very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture," warning that Iran "WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD" if Iran follows through with its threats of retaliation in the wake of Gen. Qasem Soleimani's assassination. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/us/politics/trump-esper-iran-cultural-sites.html)) 

3. **The Pentagon mistakenly released a memo that said the U.S. would be pulling troops out of Iraq**. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley told reporters that the letter itself was a draft and that its release was an "honest mistake." The document was an unsigned draft memo from the U.S. Command in Baghdad notifying the Iraqi government that the U.S. planned to reposition some of its troops and suggested the removal of troops from the country. When asked about the memo, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said it was "inconsistent of where we are right now."

4. **A captain at a for-profit immigrant detention center in Nevada is a neo-Nazi**. Travis Frey is currently employed at the Nevada Southern Detention Center, which is run by private prison giant CoreCivic and is contracted with ICE. Frey posted at least a dozen times on the neo-Nazi website Iron March while serving as head of security at a different for-profit ICE detention center in Indianapolis. Using the screen name "In Hoc Signo Vinces," Frey self-identified as a "fascist" in his profile and started putting out feelers in 2017 in an attempt to establish a white nationalist chapter in Nevada.

5. **Mike Pompeo will not run for Senate in Kansas**. The former Kansas Congressman told Sen. Mitch McConnell that he has decided against running for a Senate seat after quietly exploring his options for several months. The filing deadline for the primary is in June, so Pompeo still has time to change his mind, but administration officials who have spoken with him say he seems adamant about not entering the race.
